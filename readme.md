# NG (Next Generation) Network Scanner

Next Generation Port Scan is advanced scanner that identifies open ports and gather information about target hosts using TCP/IP stack and RFC designs to help us bypass firewalls and truly understand, if port is closed or open. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6, and includes features such as logging, multi-threading, and detailed scan results.

## Why This is a Next-Generation Network Scanner

This scanner incorporates cutting-edge scanning methods that go beyond traditional port scanning. It includes innovative techniques like:

- **Inverse Mapping Scan**: Uses invalid IP headers to map out network infrastructure.
- **Bad TCP Checksum Scan**: Bypasses basic firewall checks by sending packets with incorrect checksums.
- **ACK Tunneling Scan**: Leverages the ACK flag to tunnel data, bypassing certain types of firewalls.
- **IPv6 Extension Header Scanning**: Uses IPv6 extension headers to identify network nodes that support IPv6.
- **Flow Label Scanning (IPv6)**: Exploits IPv6 flow labels for advanced probing.
- **Fragmented ICMP Scanning**: Sends fragmented ICMP packets to evade detection systems.
- **Covert Channel Scanning**: Searches for covert communication channels within a network or public facing IP using built-in Windows, Linux packet sniffer libraries.

# Updated nmap-service-probes file

We ensured that the the original techniques of the script should use service probing from nmap-service-probes so this way, we have better chances and opportunities to bypass firewalls, IDS/IPS, and accurately identify the services. 
- Updated nmap-service-probes file have support for ports
- Updated nmap-service-probes file have spport for TCP/IP stack matching for Linux and Windows

# Evasion Techniques Used

During the scanning process, various evasion techniques were employed to avoid detection by IDS/IPS systems. Here is a detailed explanation of each technique:

1. **Randomized Source IP and Port**
    - **Description**: This technique involves altering the source IP address and port number for each packet sent to the target. This makes it difficult for security systems to correlate and detect the scanning activity.

2. **Randomized Payloads**
    - **Description**: The payload of each packet is changed randomly. This helps in evading signature-based detection systems that rely on identifying specific patterns in the packet payloads.

3. **Variable Packet Sizes**
    - **Description**: The size of the packets is varied during the scan. This can help in avoiding detection systems that might flag packets of unusual or consistent sizes.

4. **TCP Timestamp Manipulation**
    - **Description**: This technique involves altering the TCP timestamps within the packet headers. This can confuse detection systems that use timestamp analysis to detect malicious activity.

5. **IP Option Fields Manipulation**
    - **Description**: The IP option fields in the packet headers are manipulated to introduce variability and evade detection. These fields are often used for routing and control purposes.

6. **Decoy Packets**
    - **Description**: Decoy packets are sent alongside the actual scanning packets. These decoys make it harder for detection systems to distinguish between legitimate and scanning traffic.

7. **Protocol Mix**
    - **Description**: Multiple protocols are used during the scan to diversify the traffic. This can help in evading detection systems that focus on specific protocols.

8. **Adaptive Timing**
    - **Description**: The timing of the packets is adjusted dynamically to avoid detection. This can involve sending packets at irregular intervals or introducing delays.

9. **Discovers Firewall**
    - **Description**: Discovers if system or network has firewall or IDS/IPS and how it can evade or lunch attacks.

10. **Segmented**
    - **Description**: Discovers if system is part of segmention with extra details.

### Bypassing Filters

Traditional scanners often get blocked by firewalls and intrusion detection systems. This next-generation scanner is designed to bypass such filters using:

- **Malformed Packets**: Sends packets with malformed headers that can slip past traditional filters.
- **Custom Fragmented TCP**: Uses custom fragmentation to avoid detection.
- **TCP Timestamp Option Manipulation**: Manipulates TCP options to fool security devices.
- **GRE and IPsec Scans**: Uses less common protocols to evade filters focused on more common protocols.
- **Randomized TTL Values**: Uses random TTL values to avoid detection by systems that expect standard patterns.

### Enhanced Success Rate

- **False Positive Elimination**: The scanner has built-in mechanisms to eliminate false positives, ensuring more accurate results.
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging helps in analyzing scan results and troubleshooting issues.
- **Operating System Detection**: Identifies the operating system of the target, aiding in vulnerability assessments.

### Vulners

- **Banner grab and CVE Detection**: Using Vulners, you can get latest cves of the banner identified.

### Ease of Use

- **Multi-Threaded**: Utilizes multi-threading to speed up the scanning process, making it more efficient.
- **Argument Parsing**: Simple command-line arguments allow for easy customization and control of the scan.
- **Detailed Output**: Options to show detailed results, only open ports, or failed scans, providing flexibility based on user needs.
- **Plugin Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions of each scanning technique help users understand what each scan does and why itâ€™s useful.

### Built-in Packet Sniffer Capabilities

- **Windows Support**: Utilizes built-in Windows packet sniffer libraries to identify the responses and create assumptions if port is open or closed of filtered.
- **Linux Support**:  Utilizes built-in Linux packet sniffer libraries to identify the responses and create assumptions if port is open or closed of filtered.
- **Mac Support**:  Utilizes built-in Mac packet sniffer libraries to identify the responses and create assumptions if port is open or closed of filtered.
